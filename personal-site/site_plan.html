			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to entertain people with a little submarine game that they can play on the go! The game is simple but fun for the whole family.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The Target Audience is young adults who have an interest in steam submarines!</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The elements in Javascript that I will be using in my webpage to make it Dynamic are updating the lines of text on the page to change numbers to accuratly show the stats of my submarine. Additionally I will be using it to detect button presses and holds. I could use an array to keep track of all the values for the submarine. Functions would be inside of that that I can call to edit parts of the sub.</p>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>The content for my webpage will include the rules of the game.</p>
			<p>Don't get hit by torpidos. Also, don't sink into the void. You cannot go above the water, OBVIOUSLY! Don't run out of oxygen. Make sure to alway keep the boiler pressure nominal as well. This is key to normal submarine operation. You must also not run out of fuel.</p>
            <div class="image-place">
                <img src="images/submarine.png" alt="Logo image" />
            </div>
			<h3>Game Page</h3>
            <div class="image-place">
                <img src="images/blownsubmarine.png" alt="Logo image" />
                <img src="images/playersub.png" alt="Logo image" />
            </div>
			<p>This will be the game itself. There will be buttons and cool stuff going on</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				[Any additional details about home that the wireframe does not make
				clear]
			</p>
			<img src="images/webpagenormal.png" alt="home page wireframe" />
			<img src="images/webpagemobile.png" alt="home page wireframe mobile" />

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
				Each square is a button with text inside of it. The center rectangle will the a submarine image.
                The bottom will be health and the top will be depth.
